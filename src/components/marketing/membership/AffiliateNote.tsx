              Yes, some resources in our library have affiliate programs, and we
              do use those links. But here's what makes us different:
            </p>

            <div className='gradient-divider mt-6'></div>

            <p className='mt-6 text-xl'>
              We NEVER recommend something just because it has an affiliate
              program. We recommend it because it works, and if it happens to
              have an affiliate program, we'll use that link to help keep
              membership costs down.
            </p>

            <div className='gradient-divider mt-6'></div>

            <p className='mt-6 text-lg text-zinc-400'>
              Many resources we recommend don't even have affiliate programs.
              We're not here to push productsâ€”we're here to show you what
              actually works.
